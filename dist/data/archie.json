{"Headline":"NAFTA’s long road to completion","Byline":"TK TK TK","Intro":"The Trump administration has to follow a series of statutory deadlines in order to get NAFTA 2.0 passed through Congress. How far along are they?","P1":"President Donald Trump has pledged since the early days of his campaign to rewrite NAFTA, the quarter-century-old trade agreement between the U.S., Canada and Mexico that eases trade in goods and services among the three countries.","P2":"He wants it done as soon as possible, and proponents of the deal say passing a new agreement quickly will reduce uncertainty and lower the risk that Trump will grow frustrated and withdraw. But it’s no small task: Besides working with their Canadian and Mexican counterparts to work toward a new deal that all three countries find reasonable, U.S. negotiators are also charged with working with Congress to abide by a series of strict statutory guidelines that must be followed in order for the updated deal to eventually become U.S. law.","P3":"The guidelines are laid out in what’s known as Trade Promotion Authority, which allows the president to submit the final deal to Congress for a straight up-or-down vote without any amendments. But getting to that point requires Trump and his trade team to keep Congress formally in the loop starting as early as three months before negotiations even begin.","P4":"Trump himself has complained about the intricacy of the process — “fast track is the slowest track I’ve ever seen,” he <a href=\"https://www.economist.com/united-states/2017/05/11/transcript-interview-with-donald-trump\">said</a> last year — but his trade officials have committed to following Congress’ mandated timeline.","P5":"Here’s a closer look at the steps the administration has taken so far – and how much further they have to go before Trump has any shot of signing NAFTA 2.0 into law."}
